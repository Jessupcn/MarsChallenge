# Mars Mining Discovery Tournament

## My approach

I started with a vanilla JavaScript approach because it was the method used by the example. As I started to make some progress, I began to try to factor in some React and attempt to build an updating scoreboard to track the bots' progress.

## Tradeoffs I made

I decided to set the state for bots based on location because it was the fastest way to check location for painting on the grid. This has the unforunate tradeoff of making it harder to use bot location later on for something such as tracking score.

Though Framework Z is popular, I decided not to use it because I didn't feel like I was familiar enough to implement
everything in time.

## Future goals

With more time I would've implemented:

- Feature A, because it would've been really informative
- Feature B, because I think it's really cool.

Feature A would've taken roughly another 30 minutes I think, but would add a lot more information. Still, I didn't want to ignore the write-up to implement feature A,
so I decided to leave it out.

Feature B is a much longer investment, but I think it'd be really cool because of reasons X,Y,Z.
